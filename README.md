## Description

The Uber Fare Prediction project focuses on predicting the fare for future transactions within the world's largest taxi company, Uber Inc. Uber is a global ride-sharing and transportation network company that provides services to hundreds of thousands of customers on a daily basis. Managing their vast amount of transaction data is crucial for developing innovative business strategies and delivering accurate fare estimates to their customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following fields:

- **key**: A unique identifier for each trip.
- **fare_amount**: The cost of each trip in USD.
- **pickup_datetime**: Date and time when the meter was engaged.
- **passenger_count**: The number of passengers in the vehicle (driver-entered value).
- **pickup_longitude**: The longitude where the meter was engaged.
- **pickup_latitude**: The latitude where the meter was engaged.
- **dropoff_longitude**: The longitude where the meter was disengaged.
- **dropoff_latitude**: The latitude where the meter was disengaged.

## Acknowledgement

The dataset for this project has been sourced from Kaggle, a well-known platform for data science competitions and datasets. We appreciate the contributions of the data providers and Kaggle's data community.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Understand the Dataset & Data Cleanup**: Analyze the provided dataset to gain insights and clean the data if necessary. This step ensures that the data used for modeling is accurate and reliable.

2. **Build Regression Models**: Develop regression models to predict the fare price for Uber rides based on the available features. Various regression techniques will be employed to achieve the best possible predictions.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the regression models using appropriate metrics, including but not limited to:
    - R-squared (R2) score
    - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    
4. **Comparison of Models**: Compare the performance of different regression models and select the most suitable one for fare prediction.

## Technologies Used

The project will utilize popular data science and machine learning libraries and tools, including but not limited to:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks
